            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a  transition and  have heard some people  who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the  free intro course and found incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.Since  completingthe course, i've succesfully switched careers,  working  as a Software Engineer  at  a VR startup. ”

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure  from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was  encouragedto enrollby a former student of theirs who can only  say wonderful things about the program.
            They  were very hands on and I never had to wait long for  asistance. The agile team project, in particular , was outstanding. It took  my learning to the next level in a way thatno tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often refered to it during interveiws as  an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as afullstack developer after  recieving multiple offers. 100%  recommend.”
